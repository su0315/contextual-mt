I will be teaching you how to conduct research today.
Like just searching online?
Yes and no.
First of all we need to make sure the sources are legitimate.
So no blogs or editorial?
Exactly.
The first place I would look at is government websites.
They typically have accurate data that is trustworthy.
What other websites would be good?
You can also check out major institutions like banks, accounting companies, and market research companies.
Why those?
They are well known and typically publishes good market reports.
But some market reports aren't free.
So stick to the ones that are free.
What if it seems the report is useful?
You can consult with me then.
But a lot of the research you will be doing is preliminary research.
So it won't be presented to upper management.
I see.
Would there be cases when we would purchase market reports?
We will need them when we conduct detailed feasibility studies.
These will be presented to the upper management so we need to show that the information is validated by professional third-party companies.
Got it.
Hi Ben, it's nice to see you again.
Nice to see you as well.
Business has been good?
It's been a bit slow with the holiday season but that's normal.
Again thank you for coming in today.
I wanted to discuss the proposal you sent me last week.
Yes, the one regarding the market research.
I reviewed the contents internally and felt that it wasn't quite something we were looking for.
Can you be a bit more specific?
We were hoping that the research will cover more topics in depths.
But it basically covers information we already know.
Were you expecting more field work like interviewing companies?
That's correct.
If that's the case, the cost structure for our service would be different.
So it won't be a flat price?
It will be a combination.
So there will be the base price plus a monthly retainer fee for the duration of the field work.
Also, travel expense and a daily meal allowance would have to be covered as well.
I see.
How about you give me another proposal with that cost structure so I can discuss it with my boss.
Yeah I can whip that up quickly.
I think I can get you a revised proposal by the end of the week.
That would be great.
Please send it to us as soon as you can.
Will do.
Well, thank you for coming today.
Thank you for the opportunity.
This is Ben speaking.
Hi Ben this is Dennis from Company A.
Oh, hi Dennis.
How have you been?
I've been good thank you.
When was the last time we talked?
I think it was around two years ago when we renewed your insurance.
Oh right.
And I'm calling in regards to that.
Oh is it time for a renewal already?
That's right.
I just wanted to ask if your sales volume will be increasing in the next year.
That will factor into calculating the insurance rate.
You mean for our export business?
Yes that's correct.
Well, we are doing around four million in sales right now.
We anticipate that will increase to six million next year.
Do you think we can get a discounted rate?
I think so.
You guys haven't had any insurance claims since you started.
So you guys would be deemed low risk.
I think I can get you guys a lower rate.
That would be great.
I'll get back to you next week in regards to the rate.
Sounds good.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Bye now.
Hi this is Bruce.
Can you come to my office?
Yes, I'll be right there.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, have a seat.
I'm actually doing a presentation at an event and will need to introduce our company.
It's happening next week.
I was reviewing the presentation you made for me earlier this year and realized that it needs to be updated.
Sure I can do that.
Can you check if there's a new version of the company presentation from the administration department?
Yeah, they usually post new ones on the internal website.
I'll check if they have an updated one.
There's also some changes to our assets since the last presentation.
Right, there have been some changes with selling off assets and acquiring companies.
I'll send a list of changes for the presentation.
That will be helpful.
Do you think you can make me a draft by the end of today?
I think so.
It's just adding and removing content so it should be quick.
Great.
Let me know when you finish.
Yeah, I'll send over a draft as soon as I finish.
Hi Sam, can you do me a favor?
Sure.
I need you to arrange a meeting with someone from the government.
Is there a specific person you want to see?
I'm looking for someone that can give us advice on subsidies for research and development.
I want to see if there are any government programs that we can use for our project.
I think there might be some government-run programs that provides grants.
I know someone in the government so maybe he can direct me in the right direction.
I'll leave this to you then.
Try to see if you can arrange a meeting for next week.
Or even the week after.
Okay.
Who will be attending from our side?
It will be Ben and myself.
Actually, maybe you should join too.
Since you are the one arranging the meeting.
Okay.
I will keep my schedule open.
Anyways, I'll let you know once I can confirm this meeting.
Let me know when you do.
Ok, show it to me.
So, what do you think?
Yes, it's working.
So you did this by adding that?
Yes, I had to run it through a solution and then heat it though, otherwise it won't emulsify.
It's maintaining its state.
My goodness, you finally did it!
This is a technological marvel.
Well done, Ken.
I am so proud of you.
Thank you.
It was really long and laborious.
We need to patent this.
Have you done it before?
No, never.
Ok, this is going to be a great learning experience for you, so do it.
Where do I start?
I'll email you our patent attorney's info.
But before that, talk to Karen about searching for existing patents.
You need to search thoroughly to make sure nobody has the same thing, or even something similar.
Ask Karen about the criteria, she's done this many times.
Ok, and how long is the filing process?
Well you need some studies for proof.
Do you have the experiment log?
It's really scribbled and all over the place.
Well, maybe you want to run another one with a clean slate, might as well to be absolutely certain this works.
How long will that take you?
I don’t know, about a month?
Try to do it in 2 weeks.
We will file for all the applications as well so you have to start cracking on that.
Wow, there is a lot to do.
Hopefully we can get this filed by the end of next month.
My commute today was horrible.
Oh what happened?
The train that I usually take was cancelled without notice.
That sucks.
How did you get to work then?
I had to take the bus.
Oh you can get to work by bus?
Yeah, but I have to transfer three times.
That's not fun.
Yeah, the bus is always full by the time I get on.
And I can't sleep because I'm scared I'll miss my stop.
Have you thought of driving to work?
I know Ben drives to work.
I thought about it but the parking is too expensive.
How much is it?
It's around four hundred dollars a month.
Wow that's expensive.
Plus, you need to fill up on gas on a weekly basis.
I think Ben has a parking pass issued by the company.
Oh what, how come he gets one?
Beats me.
You can ask him!
I will ask him now.
Hey Ben.
Yes?
Did the company issue you a parking pass?
Yeah.
They issued one because I use my car for work.
Can I get one too?
Are you sure you want one?
Why do you say that?
Driving to work isn't as good as you think it is.
There's a lot of bad drivers and pedestrians that jaywalk.
I'm actually thinking of returning the parking pass and just take the train to work.
Oh, is that right.
Yeah, I would give it another thought.
Hmm, yeah I'll think about it.
Hi this is Sam Lee from Company A.
Who?
I'm Sam Lee from Company A.
Oh, right.
How are you doing?
I'm good thank you.
I just wanted to see if you got my email yesterday.
Oh yes, the one about rescheduling the meeting tomorrow, right?
Yes, that's right.
I did see it, but my computer has been giving me issues all morning.
Sorry for not replying your email.
No not at all.
So I wanted to ask if we can reschedule the meeting tomorrow to next week.
I'm actually attending a conference in San Francisco next week.
But I'll be back on Thursday night, so I'll be free on Friday.
Would Friday work with you?
Yes, that would be perfect.
I'm available any time on Friday.
How does ten o'clock sound?
That sounds great.
Can you send me a new meeting invite?
Yes, I will send it to you after this call.
Thanks.
Thank you very much for changing the meeting on such short notice.
No worries.
I'll look forward to the meeting next week.
Same here.
Hope you have a nice day.
You too.
Bye now.
Lisa, make sure to register for the Food Expo this week.
They’re offering 30 percent off for registering 6 months in advance.
Sure thing Eric.
I know your team has been anticipating the Food Expo all year.
What's so great about it anyway?
What do you do there?
In a nutshell, it's a chance for vendors of food items to pitch to restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores.
But, it's so much more than that Lisa.
There are exhibit halls, expert-led workshops, culinary demonstrations, and so much food!
You get to sample everything for free!
Then each night, they serve drinks, and it's a big party!
It sure sounds like fun.
Make sure you don't forget to work!
Oh we work.
We get a lot accomplished, and are able to build lasting relationships with prospective clients.
The first morning, everyone is tense because they've spent the last few days preparing their booths and setting up their products.
Then after the first day, everyone walking around, people are ready to cut loose.
This is when the real rapport building happens.
Everyone has their guard down.
It gives us a chance for genuine communication with prospective buyers.
Actually, last year I was able to close the deal with Fast Food Burger Chain A.
Now they use our cheese exclusively on their cheeseburgers.
That's awesome Eric.
What are your goals for this year?
We have decided to launch Product A this year.
Hopefully, this will create a lot of industry buzz.
We're having a hands on demonstration that is quite entertaining.
So many young employees are hired this year.
Too many millennials if you ask me.
How has it been having them work for you?
It's definitely an adjustment.
You know they are very different from our generation.
It has been a learning experience for me as well.
Obviously, the millennials have different work ethic.
I might sound a little judgmental here.
But they come off a little bit entitled and lazy.
I see what you are saying.
Our generation is willing to invest our time and effort in order to build our careers.
We were generally committed to our jobs and the companies we work for.
Yep, that's what I have been doing for the last 25 years.
But the millennials don't seem as committed as we are.
They tend to leave for new opportunities after a few years.
Their priorities are different too, right?
It seems that they wanted something that benefit them in the long run.
With the bad economy and the job insecurities the millennials have experienced, they don't expect things to stay the same.
Is that the reason they tend to switch jobs more frequently?
Maybe, but I could be mistaken.
The ones we hired this year seem pretty decent though.
I agree with you.
I need to accept the fact that they are totally different generation.
And I need to cut them some slack.
I have supervised Marissa and Caleb, and they work really hard.
I am just afraid they will leave us in a few years.
That's my fear too.
They are too good to let go.
That's another thing to consider.
We have to figure out ways to reduce turnover and increase employee retention.
Does that mean I have to be the coolest boss to make them like me?
You don't have to, but it probably will help.
But you just have to be you.
You are a great role model for them already.
Thank you for saying that.
Now let me get back to being an awesome boss and help those young people.
It was nice chatting with you.
We're almost running out of copy paper.
Oh, I didn't notice.
I'll order now.
Do you think they'll come this week?
I need to print out lots of things by weekend.
They usually deliver the next day, so it should be fine.
But I'll double check when I order, just in case.
Appreciate it.
Can you also order large envelopes together?
Sure.
Anything else?
No, that's it.
Ok, it will be done soon.
Thanks.
Excuse me, Mori-san, can I ask you something?
Yes, how can I help?
Could you check my e-mail letter to the client?
Hmm, here, I think you should change the word order, like this.
Wow, it’s so quick.
I used copy-and-paste short cut keys.
You can press control key and C to copy, and then paste it with control and V keys.
Ah, short cuts are useful, aren’t they?
You type e-mails so fast on the PC, don’t you?
I can send text messages on my mobile very fast.
You are in the smartphone generation, so you use flick input skilfully.
I can’t see small letters on my mobile screen without reading glasses.
But you can zoom in on the letters on a smartphone.
I know, even so, I can’t see the whole picture.
And my finger catches two keys at the same time, so I prefer to type on PC.
We no longer use laptops in my family.
Hmm.
Good morning, everyone.
Could I have your attention, please?
Thank you all for coming.
Let's get down to business.
The goal of this meeting is to talk about reducing paper consumption in our office.
Alex, what's your opinion on this?
I think it's a great idea.
We spent more than 10,000 dollars on purchasing printer paper last year.
That doesn't even include printer ink, paper clips, and folders.
We would save huge sums of money by going paperless.
We also dedicate too much storage space to paperwork.
Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.
Francisco, do you have any other thoughts on this?
One advantage we haven't talked about is the environmental benefits.
We'll produce less waste if we start saving our paperwork digitally.
That's also something I wanted to work on.
What do you think, Adam?
It will probably be hard to go completely paper free at once.
I think we'll probably have to take baby steps.
Each division should manage their paper usage since they all have different needs for documentation.
We could probably start by having everyone save new paperwork digitally.
Then, someone could convert the old paperwork into digital copies.
I think it would take a lot of work in the beginning, but it might help prevent papers getting misplaced in files.
That seems like a good idea.
I'll meet with the tech team to see what our options are.
We'll need to evaluate different softwares to see which will work best.
Then we can calculate how much the implementation and training will cost.
I think we can discuss these details further next meeting.
I'll go ahead and bring in someone from the tech team to show you the different software options.
Great meeting, team!
Yui, it's been a long time!
Hi, Keith, yeah, it's been ages!
Oh, by the way I heard your proposal got approved for that large-scale project.
Wow, you've heard about that all ready?
Yes, Mr. Brown was talking about that the other day.
Congratulations!
Why thank you.
It's amazing that you got recognized from Mr. Brown, the section chief with a heart of stone.
Shhh, what if he catches you calling him that.
Oh right, Keith, you were in his project team before.
Yup, he might look somewhat intimidating, but he's an able person.
That's one of the reasons I feel a bit nervous.
Well, I guess, it's a pretty big project, too.
I have to draft a staffing plan by next week, get approval from HR, aghh, I already have a lot to do.
Relax, Yui.
Look, it'll get much easier if you run it by Ms. Yasuda in HR beforehand.
But you should be careful if you do overtime when you work under Mr. Brown.
Thanks, I'll try my best.
Well, I guess I shouldn't even be here having coffee.
Hey, you should also refresh yourself with a chatty coworker, right?
Oh yeah, speaking of taking a break, are you super busy on Friday?
let's see, you mean the 19th?
Well, I really can't tell, depends on how far along I get tomorrow.
What about it?
If you can get off early, how about I buy you a drink and toast to your success.
Yay, I like that idea!
If you don't mind going to a cheapie place like that Spanish bar at the corner, though.
Doesn't matter at all, I'll push myself to get the work done on time.
Should I LINE you when I'm done?
I don't check my LINE very often so I think a text message to my mobile is better.
I don't really like that massages get marked as read, and these makes you feel like you have to reply right away.
Oh, Mr. Brown always uses LINE and he sends messages with stickers, too.
No way!!
Seriously, he does silly things sometimes.
Yeah, why don't we ask Mr. Brown to join us?
Oh no, that is too much of a challenge for me right now.
He's quite a nice guy once you get to know him and I think it'll help you when you work together.
Well, let me think about that.
Anyway, if you can't make it, can you text me ASAP?
You got it.
Hello, I’d like to buy your English publication called “Japanese Auto Parts Industry”.
Certainly, you can pre-order the latest edition at the moment.
When will it be out?
May the 1st.
Okay, how much is it?
100,000 yen per copy including the consumption tax.
H-hundred thousand yen!?
Yes.
Why is it so expensive?
I don’t know why...
Sorry but I’m not in a position to answer that.
Hmm, we can’t afford such an expensive book.
You can browse our back issues at the National Diet Library in Nagata-cho.
Ah, okay.
I may have a look first and then decide.
Can you send me the brochure for now?
Of course.
May I have your address, please?
It’s Research Department, Company A, xx-xx Akasaka, Minato-ku, attention to Murakami, please.
No Problem.
Right.
Thank you, bye.
Thank you for your call.
Overall, our company is focused on meaningful innovation that will improve people's lives.
Thank you for your attention.
I have a few minutes to answer questions.
Yes, you in the back row.
What's your name?
I'm Takahashi.
How often do people switch roles in your company?
If your employees want to try something new, is it easy for them to switch teams?
Of course!
Great question, by the way.
As a company, we strive for innovation, so we want to make sure our employees are inspired.
This means that we are more than happy to have people switch teams, but we try to keep everyone on one team for at least 6 months
As long as the change isn't disruptive and the employee continues to produce quality work, we certainly don't have a problem with it.
Next question?
Yes, you over there.
Hello, my name is Mizuno.
I was wondering, what is your favorite part about working at Company A?
Thank you!
Thank you for your question, Ms. Mizuno.
It's hard to pick just one thing!
I would say I really enjoy the people and the environment.
Everyone works hard, and it's very motivating to push myself and further my career.
I've had so much personal growth since I started with Company A, and I'm very grateful for my time here.
I can't imagine starting my career anywhere else.
Person in the front row can ask the last question.
What would you say is a missing skill or need you're looking to fill right now?
Right now, I know the marketing team is looking for more people who have a good, fundamental knowledge of social media marketing.
Unfortunately, this is the end of the scheduled time for this presentation.
Thank you again, everyone, for your interest in our company.
If you brought a resume, please hand it in up here.
I'll stick around for a few minutes if you have any further questions.
Have you heard about the new project starting next month?
Yes, about starting internal newsletters.
That's right.
We will try to offer the information on technology trends and new researches every month.
We can talk about any technological fields without limitation, can't we?
Yes, as long as those fields are relevant to us.
However, I appreciate it if you could get information on the fields where we focus most as the company.
Then, we'd better look at something related to smart appliances.
Correct.
The technologies related to washers and dishwashers are pretty good.
Maybe technologies for TV too.
Please keep an eye on the areas related to entertainment such as TVs and audio systems.
Also, it would be great if you could include some info from our industry-university collaboration with M Engineering University.
The advanced technology researches at M Engineering University are very interesting.
I know.
How is it in terms of the confidentiality?
As long as it is included in our collaboration contract, we can share it within the company.
Glad to hear.
I was worried about that a little bit.
As for the volume, I think 10 pages are the max since everyone is too busy to read a lot.
I agree, people would lose interest if there is too much info.
I've heard about making the English version, but is it happening too?
At this point, we will only do Japanese.
If we try to make the English version, it will take more time including the time to find translators.
I would like to make our current goal is to publish them regularly.
I see, it is not good if we run out of gas by trying to do too much at the beginning.
Right.
Our priority now is to establish the existence of internal newsletters for Japanese-speaking employees.
I wish this could be the reason for non-R-and-D people to get more interested in technologies.
I think people would come up with more ideas about new products because of it.
It'll also be an advantage for the sales people if they can talk about technologies.
Once the Japanese version is established and if our overseas office makes a request, we will think about the English version then.
Good idea.
I am thinking about appointing some of younger employees in our group to work on newsletters.
I will have them do the actual interviews and writing.
Then you will be the supervisor.
Exactly.
Please let me know when you pick the people.
Yes, let's make this project a success.
Definitely.
Hello, this is E Company.
Hello, this is Morita from the R and D at Company G.
Oh hi, Mr. Morita, good to hear from you.
It looks like Yamada from the product development has been waiting for your call, so please hold.
Sure.
Hi Mr. Morita, this is Yamada.
How are you?
I am calling you regarding those product prototypes.
Oh, I was waiting, thank you.
And how do they look?
We made a couple just to test out, and they look good.
Oh, that's good.
So I would like to show you those, and I wonder if you could come over here.
Of course, I can.
I think it will be hard for you to bring them here.
Yes, they are pretty heavy.
I know, we are being unreasonable in terms of specifications.
No no, that's not a problem.
It's just that they are only prototypes that they might break while being transported.
Oh right, since they are not officially products yet, you have not focused on the packaging much.
Exactly, packaging will be another matter.
Then I will visit you next week or so.
We are good anytime except for Tuesday.
I have somethng on Monday, so how about Wednesday?
It works.
If you can come over before lunch, we can have a lunch meeting together.
Sounds good, since I would like to talk to other engineers, I'll do that.
So is around ten thirty good?
Yes, sure.
Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing, but we might need prototypes for another product that is not the same as this one.
Okay?
Can I bring the spec for it next week?
It would be helpful if you could tell me it's feasible or not.
I see, please bring it with you then.
Will do.
I apologize for being unreasonable all the time.
Not a problem, actually engineers enjoy making prototypes.
It is fun to see what the actual product looks like.
Good to hear, then I will see you next week.
See you then.
Hello, I'd like to inquire about an invoice.
I will transfer you to the person in charge so please hold a moment.
Hello, my name is Hirai and I am in charge.
I'd like to ask you something in regards to an invoice that was sent a few days ago, are you okay to talk now?
Yes, do you have the invoice number in hand?
Yes, it is 157784.
Please wait a bit, ok go on.
It's in regards to the order on the tank in the second row, and a wrong model was sent to us and I'd like to cancel the order itself.
I will look into it so please hold a moment.
I'm very sorry about that, we actually send off an expedited shipment of the model you ordered but have you received it?
Yes, it arrived but we didn't end up getting it by the date we needed it so I cancelled it online.
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
I'm very sorry but will it be possible to return the product back to us again?
This is the second time, we're busy too so can you send someone over to pick it up?
Okay, I will make an arrangement with the postal office so it would be appreciated if you can prepare the return.
Okay.
Also, can you send me the new invoice by email?
Of course.
Please allow me to reconfirm your email.
Also, can I pay by credit card?
Yes, that won't be an issue.
So once we confirm the return, I will call you once again in regards to the payment so please keep note of that.
Okay, thank you.
I'm thinking of setting up a website for the company but what do you think?
I was just thinking that we should make one soon, but we don't have anyone that knows a lot about it and is something that we've been pushing back.
This area is rural and there are a lot of seniors so we still tend to rely on print advertisement but I think it is about time we made one.
I'm not that well versed so the design will be simple but I'm thinking of trying to make one.
Okay, I'll leave it to you.
Inoue-san, can you help him?
Okay.
Once the website is done, we should add the web address on the phone booklet, advertisement, and company car too.
I want to add photos of the employees, company and before-after photos of houses we worked on as much as possible.
We have the photos saved in one folder so you can use as much as you'd like.
We should get permission from the clients too, right?
Yeah, I'll contact them on this.
Can you look at the pictures and list up which houses you want to upload and show me?
Okay.
Come to think of it, we got an email the other day asking us if there will be any changes for next year's phonebook.
I recall it saying that we need to let them know by this month if there will be changes.
Then we should make it quickly and hopefully be able to meet the deadline.
But surprisingly there are a lot that are flyers that we have posted at supermarkets and community centers, and we get inquiries that locals used our company to repair their exterior walls.
Okay, I will add the website URL and repost it once those are done as well.
The chiropractic hospital that I go to said they can let me leave business cards there so we should add it on there too.
It seems we will be busy once the website is finished too.
I plan on adding a feature so we can take reservations online in the future but I don't have that much knowledge on it so what should we do?
Well let's at least have our company number in the contact information and have them be able to contact us over the web even if it's not taking reservations.
I think I should be able to do something like that.
I will make it so we will get a notification on our company email when a customer makes an inquiry over the web.
Then we should decide who will be in charge of replying those.
Let's have another meeting once the website is done.
Alright, I'll leave it to you guys Tanaka-san and Inoue-san.
There is a new bento place.
What's it like?
Kind of like a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisine.
But the person making it is Thai so Thai food might be good.
Oh, I actually like Vietnamese food though.
But Julie, you only like pho, right?
Don't you think a noodle and soup for take out wouldn't taste good?
Right, then what do you recommend?
I bought pad-thai today, do you want to try it?
Yes, thank you.
This is good, I'll go take a look too.
I'd avoid the ones with strong herbal smells.
Our cafeteria is small and there are people who would not be happy with the smell.
Okay.
I bought green curry and summer roll.
That looks good.
What are you two eating?
Thai food, there is a new bento stall in front of the building.
It's good!
I'm jealous of skinny girls who can eat what a lot without worrying about the calories.
Isn't that like sexual harassment or some sort of harassment, and it shouldn't be something you should say, right?
Oh, I guess I shouldn't talk about appearances.
Yeah, you should be careful as that's something the company is pretty stringent on.
But still, how come our company cafeteria has an annoying rule of only 1 main dish and 2 side dishes?
Because if we have a buffet, people like Ken will eat too much and maybe they aren't able to make a profit?
Oh please, I don't eat that much.
We all know that you always put a lot on your plate.
You can't work if you're hungry!
There it is, you and your Sengoku period quotes.
Maybe I should go work at the office in the building beside from us.
They say that the cafeteria is the building next to us is really good.
Yeah, the work environment is important.
Especially for a big eater like me, where the food environment is very important.
Us slim girls can't eat a lot so we're more focused on the content.
So, if we eat at the company cafeteria everyday, we can't survive even if it's free.
Well, I think there is no better meal than a free meal.
So, I will go grab some of the company meal.
They have loads of green peas that you don't like as the side dish today.
Oh, maybe I have to go buy a bento too?
Ken, lunch break is almost over.
Hey, Kyle, good work today.
Oh, Kiichi, I thought you've left already.
Do you still have something you'd like to ask about the workshop?
Not really, I just wanted to talk to you.
Are you still working after this?
I believe I have....
No, a meeting has been postponed until Friday.
I'm done for the day now.
Then, you can join me for a drink, huh?
You always push me too much, Kiichi.
Oh well, it's been a long time, you know?
Well, I have no reason to say no.
You rather like drinking, don't you?
It all depends on where and with whom I drink.
So I passed your test, I guess?
Yeah, you should be proud.
I'm quite sensitive and particular about people.
Ha-ha, not bad if you can talk to me like that, Kyle!
I had been taken around by a tireless boss like you since I started working.
Anybody would be tough.
I enjoyed training disobedient but earnest newbie like you.
You did, for eight long years.
Thanks to you, I can deal with any important people now, even pretty difficult ones.
That means you owe what you are today to me, right?
No one can think as positive as you do, Kiichi.
Well, I have something to say, Kyle.
When you got promoted to the corporate planning, I let you leave the sales because you'd get into the fast lane there.
If I knew that you were going to request a transfer in four years to marketing too, I wouldn't have let you go.
You've raised me so that I can stand on my own now.
I'll show you that I'm capable of building up a reputation for CX promotion soon.
Ah, okay, I'll see how artfully you do that.
Ha Ha, I think you'll enjoy it.
Anyway, you don't mind the soba place we used to go, do you?
They have fine sake this time of the year.
Sounds good.
I'll go back to my office to get my bag.
It's okay if you go ahead, Kiichi.
All right.
If you take too long, I'd start by myself, alright?
As you please.
Well I've printed out the resumes and cover letters we received.
Wow that's a lot.
There are over a hundred here.
How long was the posting up for?
It was up for around twenty days.
So do you want to review them now?
Yes, let's do it.
So what's the tip in screening job applications?
Well, we don't have time to review every single one of them.
I typically do a quick review of their cover letter.
If their cover letter is interesting then I will look at their resume.
If that seems okay then I'll put them in the shortlist pile.
I'll give it a try.
Let's see.
Oh this person is interesting.
He used to work at a shipping company as a logistics coordinator.
Let's see.
His writing skills are a bit questionable though.
There's some odd looking sentences in his cover letter.
He's older than me too.
That could make things awkward right?
That's up to you really.
I personally don't mind.
I mean Elaine is a lot older than me.
Good point.
I'll think about it.
A lot of it is about gut feeling.
Once you actually meet the person, you can usually tell if this is the person you want to hire or not.
I can't wait to meet them!
Well, they will have to get on your shortlist first though!
Hi, this is Ricky Lyon from K fabrics.
May I please speak to Ayana Williamson?
This is she.
I am calling about the order you placed at our store earlier today.
I just got a word from our warehouse that the fabric you want is actually back-ordered.
What does back order mean?
Am I not getting it at all?
Well, back order means the item is temporarily out of order causing a delay on your order.
But the store associate I saw earlier placed an order for me.
The particular pattern you want is in high demand.
And obviously there was miscommunication between our store and the warehouse.
I am sincerely sorry for the disappointment.
Oh no, I was really looking forward to getting the fabric.
None of the other stores had it in stock either.
Do you happen to know when it will be in stock?
The warehouse manager believes it won't be another month or so.
Meanwhile, I am doing my best to source it from a different vendor for you.
But I do not have much luck.
As I mentioned already, most places have run out of them due to its popularity.
Well, I can not wait another month.
Do you have any pattern that is very similar to the one I want?
I am actually opening up our sample book right now.
You wanted the paisley one with turquoise background, right?
Yes, the patterns are green, white, and navy blue.
I have one that's almost identical.
The only difference is the background color.
It's teal, but the colors of the patterns are exactly the same.
Well, I would like to go ahead and get it then.
Unfortunately, we don't have it in stock at our store right now.
But it seems that the store in the town, Slidell, has some.
I can have it delivered here or you can go pick it up yourself.
Whichever works better for you.
I think I am going to drive up there to pick it up.
I apologize again.
I hope you will consider us again for your future shopping.
Jack, you really did an amazing job last quarter.
You flatter me.
It was hectic, but we made it through.
Yes it was, but you did it, and you did it well.
Thank you for saying so.
You brought up sales and made a huge profit for the company.
Well, actually if it wouldn't have had the support from you and the entire department, I cold have never done it.
You're too kind Jack.
Actually, I have some really good news.
You aren't going to believe this.
What?
What's going on?
The board has decided to give you a bonus!
What!?
Oh that's great Kim.
How much?
3,000 dollars.
Oh my god, that's too much Kim.
Thank you so much.
This is amazing.
Well, you've certainly earned it Jack!
Say, it is Friday, I was thinking that all of us could go out and celebrate.
Oh yeah, for sure.
Hi there, I'm picking up some bags for Company A.
Can I get your name please?
It's Sam Lee.
Can I also get your order number?
Yes, it is 47238.
Okay, yes we have the bags ready for you.
I'll have Greg take care of the rest for you.
Hi there, you must be Sam.
I'm Greg.
Hi there I'm Sam Lee from Company A.
It's nice to put a face to the name.
So I have your bags ready for loading at the loading bay.
Before we head out, can you just sign this invoice?
Yes I can.
Okay, let's head out now.
So the bags are pretty heavy so I will use a small forklift to load it into your car.
Which car is yours?
It's the black SUV over there.
Alright, can you open the trunk?
I'll bring the bags over with the forklift and directly load it in.
Sure.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
Hi, this is Sam Lee from the Seattle office.
Oh, hello there.
I was wondering if you can get me a risk assessment report.
Of course.
Can you send me the details of the company?
Yes I can.
Can you tell me what information I need to give you?
So in order to get the report, I'll need the company name, address, phone number, and website
Will that be it?
Yes, that will be it.
Okay, I will send that over right now.
How long will it take to get the report?
I think it will take a few days.
I'll let you know once I get the report.
Great, thank you very much.
I'll look forward to hearing from you.
Have a good one.
Bye now.
Good morning, Mr. Ken.
Good morning, Steve.
Let me take you to your work desk and then I will give you a tour of the office.
Here is your desk and work starts from 8am to 5pm every day, Steve.
Oh, very nice!
Drop your belongings here, and let’s go!
OK, I am ready Mr. Ken.
That is Suzy over there and is our senior financial analyst.
You will be working with her in the future so let’s go say hi to her.
Suzy, this is Steve, our department’s new addition.
Welcome on board, Steve.
I am very glad to see you!
I am very happy to be here.
Just let me know whenever you need me.
I am glad to be of any assistance.
I am giving Steve a tour of the office so that he knows his way around.
Ok, oh and please do teach him where the vending machines are located Ken.
See you later, Steve!
OK, Suzy.
At the end of the hallway is the Production area.
Seventy percent of our merchandise is produced right here in this facility and we also have one smaller manufacturing facility overseas that handles the rest of the production.
You will be dealing with John, the Production manager.
I will introduce you to him later because he is in a meeting at the moment.
Right, I need to remember that name.
Like I said during the interview, one of your daily jobs is to deal with the bank to keep track of our financial resources.
Every morning, you will access our account through the Internet to get financial information.
I should have a login and password, right?
Yes, I will call our bank and inform them that you are our new employee.
Your next task is to call overseas to get other necessary information.
What kind of data do I need to get from our people overseas?
You will need financial data about their current and future projects.
Do they need any information from me?
Yes, you need to work with them on their budgets so you can fax or e-mail them the information and if you need to talk to them, call them as soon as you get in.
Remember that they are eight hours ahead of us.
Make sure that you create a file for each overseas project so you and I can review them at the end of every week.
In the beginning, can you review the files with me more often?
I just want to make sure that I do my job correctly.
Yes, come see me whenever you have questions.
I can't believe that you're leaving us.
Yeah, it will be very weird without you here.
I didn't expect that this will happen so soon.
Well, it's your life.
You should go for it.
Why not?
Honestly, I don't think I could do what you are doing.
You mean moving to a different country?
Of course there's that.
I mean leaving this big company to pursue your real dream.
I know, I had to argue a lot with my husband about this.
Hey, did you try the special cocktail?
I ordered it just for you.
Thank you for organizing this party for me.
You totally deserve this.
We love parties anyway.
Especially when we can have it right where we work.
Let me go and grab some cocktails for you guys.
Do you want something to eat, too?
I'm not that hungry.
Oh, trust me, you will need something otherwise you can't drink tonight.
Alright, just bring me anything you like.
I will be right back!
Are you excited about your new job?
I'm not sure.
I think there will be some good points and bad.
Yeah, I'm really happy for you though.
People think that we have everything just because we work here, but you know that's not true.
Thanks for saying that.
Just don't forget to let us know how you're doing now and then.
Thank goodness we have internet, right?
Yes, it's a small world with internet.
You should come and visit me while I'm in India.
I would love to visit.
Can I join for that trip, too?
Here's your food and drinks.
Thanks so much.
This looks amazing.
Hello everyone, and good morning.
As you all know by now, the company is in the red for this fiscal year.
Because of this, I have some bad news.
Unfortunately, we will be reducing our usual holiday bonuses for this year.
The financial department has notified me that this is necessary, and it seems like there is nothing much we can do about it.
How much of a reduction are we talking about?
There will be a 20% cut to this year's holiday bonuses.
Also bonuses will be paid in two months.
But please be aware that there will be no layoffs.
That is good to hear, I guess.
Will there be any other spending cuts?
Actually, yes there will be.
Our company will be suspending all business travel temporarily until further notice.
I see, when will this go into effect?
This is effective immediately.
So please cancel any travel plans you may have in the near future.
This is rather inconvenient.
Yes, it certainly is.
Actually, we had plans to visit Company B in Taiwan in February.
They've been valuable business partners over the past year.
It's unfortunate I will have to cancel this meeting with them.
Well, we hope these funding cuts will only be for a short term.
I will notify you all as soon as I have any more information.
Apologies to everyone for the inconvenience.
Ok, hope to hear a good news from you soon.
Hello Mr. Kato, good evening.
Good evening Mr. Araki.
As you know, we have meetings twice per year to review the performance of each employee.
We are planning to meet with all of the employees in your department over the next five days.
I see.
There is no need to be nervous.
Shall we get started?
Yes, please continue.
Okay sure.
So how is your relationship with your coworkers lately?
I feel that I cooperate well with my coworkers.
I communicate with everybody in my office, and we regularly share ideas between each other.
Are there any issues with coworkers you’d like to mention?
No, none at all.
Everybody is very friendly and helpful.
That's good to hear.
We encourage collaboration between coworkers.
Have you been happy with your personal performance over the past 6 months?
Yes, I feel that I have been doing well lately.
I've been with the company for two years and I've got used to my job.
Also over the past six months I've been taking classes outside of work to learn excel.
This has helped improve my efficiency at work and I'm sharing my new information with my coworkers.
I see, that's great that you are taking these classes.
I'm sure that information is helpful to the whole office.
Do you have any weaknesses or things you'd like to improve on in the future?
Well, often I get stressed if I miss a deadline or if I have too much work to do in a short amount of time.
Managing my stress better is definitely something I would like to work on.
Yes, managing stress is important.
Actually, I have a book on managing stress in the workplace.
It may be helpful to you.
Why don’t you stop by my office tomorrow and I'll lend it to you.
That would be great, thank you so much!
No problem at all.
Ok, I have one final question.
Do you have any concerns about working here at Company A, or any questions for me?
No I don't.
I enjoy working here and hope I can stay for a long time.
That's great to hear!
Well, thank you for your time, you can go back to your desk now.
Thank you.
Hey Victor, what are you working on?
I've been setting up my retirement from the past week.
How do you have your savings for retirement set up?
All of mine is invested into Company A stock.
Company A matches everything that we put in up to four percent.
How about you, Victor?
Yes, some of mine goes into Company A stock.
However, many people have watched their retirement dreams disappear because they invested only in the company stock of their employer.
That's why I've been working on mine.
You've got to diversify, Tim.
Well, I think money is a very personal matter.
Are you trying to get into my business?
No, no, no, not at all.
I'm just looking out for you, Tim.
Most people do exactly what you do, but in the long term, it doesn't make sense.
I was doing it too, but I started doing some research.
Well then, what do you suggest?
Here's the thing, if Company A fails, we lose everything and the stock will be worthless.
Go with a target-date mutual fund.
What's that?
It's a fund holds a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.
Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund's investment strategy.
Target date funds are designed to be long-term investments for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.
Wow, I'll have to check it out.
Do you do that by yourself, or did you hire an accountant?
I've been doing it myself.
Good morning, this is Harry from the warehouse, how may I help you?
Good morning Harry, this is Charlie from the Marketing department.
I would like to know whether the new year calendar has arrived or not?
I'm sorry, as I wrote in the email the new year calendar might arrive late.
Oh, so when it will be delivered to our office?
Our vendor said it will be delivered around early January.
Would you please call me later when the calendar arrive?
Sure, I will.
Just to make sure, you ordered 200 pieces right?
Yes, that's right.
Okay, I would also like to tell you that our vendor will not send the calendar to your office at once, but divided into several batches.
So, maybe if you ordered 200 pieces, I can give you around 50 pieces at first.
And then, if our vendor send it again the next day, I can give you another 50 calendars.
This is because we also need to deliver the calendar to our branch offices throughout the country.
And we need time for delivery to our branch offices.
Okay, I understand that.
Just please inform me when the calendars are ready.
Because it's already late.
Okay.
Is there anything else I can help you?
No, that's all.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good afternoon everyone.
First of all, happy new year.
I would like everyone here to give ideas for this year.
Ideas for each employees to improve their performance this year.
Simple ideas are welcome, we don't need complicated ideas, if everyone can improve their own performance, our company will perform better too.
The ideas could be how to improve the sales or how to improve the service to our customers.
Any comment guys?
When we must give our ideas?
Today is Friday evening, so how about Monday morning?
So we can think over the weekend while we're having our holiday.
Okay, no problem.
I guess everyone here also agree.
So Monday morning we meet again at 9, is that okay everyone?
Okay.
Okay.
Sorry, I have an appointment with client next week on Monday.
Can we meet later at around 3 pm?
No problem, or you can just submit your ideas in writing and give it to Felix.
Yes, I don't mind.
Just submit your ideas to me, and I will compile it together with my ideas.
Okay then I will submit it to Felix.
Thank you.
Okay, then, see you guys on Monday.
See you.
See you.
See you.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
May I meet Ms. Diana?
Sure, where are you from?
I'm Willy from ABC company.
Have you made an appointment with her?
Yes, I've made an appointment already.
Okay, please wait a moment.
Thank you.
Hi, Mr. Willy.
Oh, Ms. Diana.
Welcome, please come in.
Thank you.
How are you?
Good, how are you?
Good, thank you.
Please have a seat and wait for a moment here.
I will ask the others to join the meeting.
Okay.
Hello, I'm Cynthia.
Hello, I'm Willy, nice to meet you.
So, let's start our meeting.
We have reviewed your proposal, is this the best price you can give to us?
Yes, actually, we can give you 10 percent discount.
Actually we received another quotation from another source, and they give us better price than your company.
Their price is cheaper and also they offered us more discount than you.
May I know how much discount they give?
They offered us 15 percent discount.
Okay, so I will give you the same discount they offered to you.
Okay, good.
We will discuss your proposal further internally and will revert to you as soon as possible.
Okay, I will be waiting for your positive response.
Please excuse me then.
Thank you very much for coming.
No problem, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sure, I will, thank you.
Okay then, see you.
See you.
Hello?
Hi Chris, it's Ryan.
Oh, hey man.
Listen, could you do me a massive favor and cover this morning's meeting?
Why, what's the matter?
On the way to the station just now, a car sped through a massive puddle and absolutely soaked me.
I've got to go home and change, I can't meet a potential client like this.
Oh man, that's terrible.
You know they can get fined for that now, did you catch their number plate?
No, unfortunately it all happened too fast.
But anyway, there's no way I'm going to make it in on time now.
Okay, don't worry I can meet with the client.
The proposal and other documents are all on the shared drive, right?
Yeah, it's all there.
You can ring me if anything's not clear.
No worries, go and get yourself dried off.
Thanks man, I owe you one.
I'll hold you to that!
Let me know how it all goes, okay.
Will do.
Alright, see you later.
Bye.
Hi Sam.
Oh, hi Chris.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
Oh, by the way, congratulations on your son's wedding last week.
Thank you very much.
So I just wanted to double check our schedule tomorrow.
You will be flying in around 9 o'clock tomorrow, right?
Yes, that's right.
Okay, so I will pick you up, then drive to the site.
The drive will take around two hours.
And I think the site inspection will take another two hours.
Your flight is at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, right?
That's right.
We should have enough time, right?
Yeah, I think so.
It's a domestic flight so you don't have to get to the airport so early.
You should be fine as long as you get there one hour earlier.
Great.
Think we are all set then?
Don't forget to bring your inspection gear.
Right.
You'll need your helmet, vest, and steel-toed boots.
It might rain so you should dress appropriately.
Thanks for the reminder!
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll look forward to it.
Bye for now.
Do you need to buy anything for this fiscal year?
Like?
Like office supplies.
Like a mouse, charger cable, things like that.
We still have some leftover budget so if you need to buy anything then buy it now.
Oh, I see.
Can I get another monitor?
Sure why not.
Do you really need it though?
Yeah I do actually.
I need it when I do research or enter data.
It will be a lot more convenient if I have two screens so I can look at two things at the same time.
Otherwise, I'll have to keep alt tabbing.
Okay.
Monitors are pretty cheap these days.
I've seen a twenty-seven inch go for around a hundred dollars.
Can you send me an email on which monitor you want?
Okay.
Can you also include the administration department in the email?
Got it.
Hello all, thank you for gathering today.
Yichin do you mind if we all speak English today as Sylar is here?
Of course not, how are you Sylar?
Hi Yichin, good to hear your voice.
How is Australia?
Sweltering actually.
Tokyo was much better, it sucks to be back here.
So I've got you 2 on the phone because I wanted to make sure we are on the same page regarding your fund's intentions with our company.
Sylar has given me some feedback in confidence as to some concerns he has.
Yes, I got an email from Sylar regarding that.
I've taken his concern to Wang Feihong and he has been looking at past financials to see where you may be heading.
Just between you and me, and Syler of course, this doesn't look good.
Wang Feihong is mostly concerned at how, what's the word, um, careful, Keiko is.
Yichin, it's fine, you don't have to sugar coat.
She is way too stubborn and slow.
He was expecting some sort of change by now, but it seems to be the same, if not worse.
Eugina, the board meeting was a disaster.
She was shutting Alex off, and dancing around my questions.
I can't imagine Wang Feihong himself sitting at that meeting.
He will explode.
Yes, you told me she didn't answer any of your questions..
It's very disrespectful as we are one of your biggest investors.
I don't know what to say other than I deeply apologize for their behavior.
Is she okay though?
Meaning?
Well, is she, um, having some sort of, I don't know, breakdown?
I don't understand how she can live in la-la land that long.
There seems to be something wrong and I'm worried for her wellbeing.
That's a new take.
I didn't think about that, but yeah, that is a possibility.
I don't know her personal affairs, or her medical history, so I can't really weigh in on that.
But I do believe something needs to be done for the sustainability of our company and I am counting on C Fund for direction.
So I'm still committed to working with you to turn things around for Company R, but just as a heads up, Wang Feihong himself will not be focusing on you guys.
He has allowed me to work with you, but there won't be any input from him.
Thank you for being straight with me.
Eugina, I think this information should just be among us.
Well, I actually think this is a good wakeup call for them.
If they know C Fund is losing interest, they may finally get their act together.
It's up to you what you tell management, but please remember I am still here.
It's better not to completely burn bridges.
Thank you for coming in.
This unprecedented weather is wreaking havoc on us, and there has been some overflow of pipes in the roof.
I apologize for the leaks you see around you.
I have heard on the news that 30 percent of Tokyo's buildings have burst pipes.
The subway station had buckets everywhere too.
Yes, so, I would like to get back to the interview and introduce you to our team.
This is Sylvester Ko, our CFO, and this is Karim Ahuja who leads the IT team.
You will be working closely with Karim.
Hello, nice to meet you both.
So thank you for doing a video interview with me the other day, today is really to get a feel of what you will be doing here, and whether you will be interested.
I'll let Karim do the talking.
Hi Sergei.
So Dr. Toshinaga forwarded me your CV and I believe you are exactly the person we need.
Basically you will be doing what you have done at your previous company.
You will be overseeing the sales office system and taking care of their issues.
There will be some backend work on our website when necessary, as well as taking care of our enterprise system.
The enterprise system is something we just installed, and the learning curve for our employees is quite steep.
They are going to have a lot of questions, so I will guide you through the basics so you can deal with the tickets.
Yes, I think I can handle that.
We had a complicated enterprise system at my previous job but it only took me a few days to understand it.
What's that cracking sound?
I don't hear it.
Something is definitely cracking.
Oh no, Sergei watch out!
What just happened?
Sergei, I'm so sorry, let me grab a towel.
This place is a mess!
I've been splashed as well!
Did that ceiling panel just cave in with the weight of water?
Oh dear, Sergei, you are all wet, are you ok?
Obviously we can't continue with the interview, but I would like to extend an offer.
Not just because of this, mind you, your CV is stellar and Karim is happy as well.
My cashmere suit is wet!
Here, Sergei, let me take that jacket so I can blow it with this dryer.
I'm not wearing cashmere so I'm ok, thank you Karim.
I apologize for this mess, please send us your dry-cleaning bill.
I insist.
I've extended an offer, Karim.
That's great, Dr. Toshinaga.
Well, thank you but let me go home and think it over.
Hello, everyone.
I am glad to see we have a big audience today.
So I'm sure you guys are eager to hear more about what I have to say today.
But before I start, I'd like to thank Government Agency A and Company A for co-organizing today's event.
Also, I'd like to thank Mike Mostow for his work in helping the deal materialize.
Mr. Mostow, would like to say something to the audience?
Yes, thank you Chris.
As you may all know, the trade deal was signed earlier this year.
Although there were some issues along the way, all the government officials involved have made sure things went smoothly.
We appreciate your hard work Mr. Mostow.
And I'm happy to be here today to have Chris and his team present to you the new trade deal.
Chris, I will hand the floor back to you.
Thank you very much Mr. Mostow.
Alright, let's get right into it then.
The CPTPP is a new trade agreement between eleven countries.
Of the eleven, seven countries have already officially joined while the remaining four are still in the discussion phase.
The seven countries that have signed on are, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and Vietnam.
The four remaining are, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, and Peru.
So the biggest feature of this trade deal will be the reduction or removal of tariffs on a large number of goods.
For Canada, one of the biggest benefit is the reduction of tariffs for meat products in to the Asian market.
One of Canada's key market will be Japan and we expect the trade of meat products to increase greatly.
Key products will be beef and pork.
Now aside from the tariffs, the deal also brings other benefits among the countries.
For example, this will open up opportunities for other companies in other countries to bid for government contracts.
Typically, government contracts can only be bid by the local companies but this will change that.
And with the reduction or removal of tariffs, it will allow foreign companies to be more competitive in bidding for government contracts abroad.
So the trade deal is not a simple reduction or removal of tariffs but has other features to promote the prosperity of the countries involved.
I could go on for hours but since we still have a whole day ahead of us, I will stop around here.
So after this, we will have a panel session with the trade commissioners from Government Agency A.
They will provide their insight on the benefits of the trade deal, and explain some of the government programs that companies could use.
These would be things that exporters could potentially use to expand to a new market.
The panel session will be held in the room behind me so please head on over after this.
Thank you and I hope everyone learns a lot from today's event.
Hey Ben, do you know where this shipment will be going to?
It's the one to Shanghai.
Are you asking about the Company?
Yeah and their address.
Freight Forwarder A is asking for the BL instruction and they need to know the name of the consignee by the end of the day.
Elaine usually does this but she took the day off today.
It should be the same as the last shipment to Shanghai.
So it should be Company B.
But don't quote me on it.
Okay.
Oh, why don't you check the phytosanitary application that Elaine sent out yesterday?
That should have the information you're looking for.
Oh, I didn't see that email.
Do you know when she sent the email?
It should have been yesterday morning.
Let me check.
Yeah, she sent it out around 11 o'clock yesterday.
Oh, but she didn't Cc you in the email.
Oh, no wonder.
Can you forward that email to me?
Yes, I'll do that now.
Great, thank you.
I'll send her a note to always include you in these kind of emails.
Yes, please.
Otherwise I won't be able to cover for her when she's away!
Hey, Han, please come and check our intern's work.
He's unbelievable.
Yes, yes I am checking it right now.
Did he spend all night messing up all these files?
It seems that way.
At least he's persistent.
Maybe that's it though.
Why didn't you tell him what the problem is?
Why should I do that?
He won't survive here anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
Is he preparing for his presentation now?
Who's going to be his partner?
Who knows.
By the way, who hired him?
Do you have any clue about that?
I have no idea who hired him.
I have a briefing with the senior manager now.
Okay.
I will see you later.
Good morning sir.
I made...
We saw it already.
You surely proved it quantity-wise.
But, that's it.
Hey, you!
Why did you ignore the folder trees that Mr. Han had made?
I didn't ignore them, but there were so many files that didn't fit there.
That's the company standard.
Do you know what that means?
Everyone understood and agreed on it.
Sorry sir, I will keep that in my mind.
You don't have to be sorry, just try to remember that for next time.
We all work together.
Scott, have you got a minute?
Yes, what's up?
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
That depends what it is.
Well, John has asked me to design and write a brochure to promote the new service.
I don't want to let him down, but with the sales reports due for next week and the trade show to prepare for, it's a bit much for me to take on at the moment.
If you have the time, I was hoping you might be able to whip something up?
If I remember correctly, weren't you the one who spearheaded that project?
Surely someone so instrumental in its development would do a better job?
Yes, but graphic design is not my forte.
Plus, I now need to put all my effort into things like the trade show, to help get my baby released to consumers.
Okay, I understand.
It shouldn't be a problem, and I do enjoy that kind of work.
Yes, I remember what a great job you did on the design work for the M contract.
I know it will be done well if I leave it in your hands.
Yes, well don't forget I'm also covering for Mark while he's off with the flu.
If anything comes through from one of his clients, that will have to take priority.
Yes, of course.
I'll see if I can make a start after lunch today.
Thanks Scott, I really appreciate it.
I'll be on hand if you have any questions.
I'll be out of the office for a bit with the preparations, so you might have to reach me by email.
No worries.
So, I just wanted to touch base with everyone, and see what stage everyone is at.
Simone, how's it going sourcing a manufacturer?
Pretty good, I have some promising leads in China.
One factory I spoke to is pretty confident they can create the shapes we require with their CNC machines, based on the designs I sent them.
They know the designs are a very early work in progress though, right?
The final design is likely to be quite different.
Yes, I made them aware of that, and they suggested we also design a custom jig when we know what the final design will look like.
Hmm, that's a good idea.
Yeah, it would help them get the production started right away.
Now, Asa, what's been going on in your team?
Well, at the beginning of last week, we fell behind schedule.
This is something I've already discussed with my team, and we came up with some better practices, and were back on track by Friday.
That's great.
Then, on Tuesday, we invited some members of the public to come and trial the different materials and color combinations, and we explained the various features.
We gained some really valuable feedback, which we have shared with the design team.
Yes, Ian couldn't make it today, but he wanted to reiterate how grateful he was for that.
He said the feedback gave him and his team confidence that they are moving in the right direction, and has informed them what they need to focus on next.
Great.
Lastly, Vanessa, do you have anything to share?
Well, as you all know, we had a great brainstorming session for the product name, and came up with some options that we thought reflected our brand and the concept really well.
Yes.
Unfortunately, the legal team has since got back to us and rejected our number one candidate, as there is already a product with that name.
Another favorite could apparently be deemed offensive in Spanish, so it looks like it's back to the drawing board.
Not to worry, it's still early days.
Right, let's wrap it up there.
We'll reconvene in 2 weeks to share what progress we've made.
Did you hear back from Company A yet?
No, not yet.
I sent them an email last week.
I'm planning to follow up with them on Friday this week if I don't hear back.
Why don't you try calling them?
Actually the person in charge is out of the country this week so I was hoping he'd reply my email.
He's in Europe right now and it's a bit hard to reach him by phone.
I mean, I wouldn't want someone calling me when I'm on a business trip.
Especially when I'm sleeping or something.
Okay, fair enough.
Be sure to follow up on this though.
Our team in Tokyo has been waiting for a reply and we should at least let them know what is up by the end of this week.
Yes, I understand.
I'll update the team in Tokyo on Friday regardless.
Thank you.
Hey Laura, can we talk for a bit now?
Yeah, sure!
Great.
Oh by the way, how was your holiday?
Did you enjoy Lisbon?
Oh it was brilliant!
The weather was perfect, food was great, people were all so nice!
Paul got himself addicted to the egg tarts and he was eating at least 3 everyday throughout the stay.
Haha!
He's now relentlessly googling the recipe so that he can recreate it.
Oh that's nice!
Make sure he cooks some for me too.
Definitely!
Ok, so, I wanted to set a meeting with Company T next week and I was wondering when you would be available to attend.
Basically they can do any day so it's up to us.
Oh yeah, I will be able to go out, give me a sec, let me check my schedule.
Ok, I can do Wednesday and Thursday.
Also Friday but only after 2 p.m.
I will have a meeting all morning and a lunch appointment with my trainee right after that.
Ok thanks!
I can do Wednesday too so that's great.
I will email them then set the time and let you know.
Ok, sounds great.
I will send us the list of documents we need by then to remind us.
Thanks!
Excuse me, I would like to get some stationery.
What kind of stationery?
I want a red non-permanent marker.
Didn't you see it on the supply shelf?
I looked for it but didn't find it.
We might have some in the storage.
Do you need it soon?
The sooner the better.
Ok, I will go see it now.
Please do.
Can I ask you one more favor?
What is it?
This is no rush, but I would like a new pair of scissors.
There weren't any scissors on the supply shelf either.
We don't keep new scissors on the supply shelf.
We only keep consumable goods on the supply shelf.
I see, what should I do?
I will see if there are some along with markers.
I will get a pair for you right away if there are any.
If not, I will place an order from the supply company and should receive them tomorrow.
I gotcha.
Oh, another thing, the take-out chart was completely filled.
You should probably get a new one out.
Thank you, I will get to it right away.
Isn't the entrance to our company a little drab?
It gets cleaned regularly but it is too plain.
Well, it's definitely not vibrant.
When you come into the entrance, all you see is the company name, the reception furniture, and the telephone.
Well, a plant is there too.
But we got this plant as a gift from our client when our office moved.
Some of the leaves are dying though.
Takada-san, you have visited many companies, haven't you?
Do you remember any company that has an impressive entrance?
Since it varies greatly depending on the size of a company, it might not be very useful.
The most impressive one by far is J brokerage.
It is a large international brokerage firm, so it's not helpful to compare though.
How was it?
The whole floor is dedicated to the reception area.
In addition, it's 18th floor of a building that is right next to Tokyo Station with glass windows, which offers a breathtaking view.
There are two female receptionists sitting at the front desk, and once you sign in, you will be guided to the sofa in an area that reminds you of a hotel lobby.
You can wait elegantly until you get guided to the office floor.
As hospitable as a luxury hotel.
That sounds awesome.
Can you think of any company that is more like our level then?
Foreign hedge fund managing company H might be it.
How was it?
It's in a building adjacent to a hotel in Hibiya.
The entrance isn't that big, it's probably the same size as ours.
It is very classy.
When you open the door, you see the company logo hung up and a telephone placed on a glass table.
That sounds pretty similar to ours.
And there was a fresh flower arrangement in a large vase, and it smelled wonderful.
It wasn't overpowering, just enough floral scent.
Olfactory stimulation can be useful.
Can we borrow their idea and add a fresh flower arrangement?
Then should we straighten up and do it as a trial?
Let's see how people react to it.
Sounds good, let's do it.
Noda-san, can I ask you something?
Yes, what is it?
My client, A Securities, is moving their headquarters on the fifteenth of next month.
I'd like to send them a gift.
Do you know what you want to send and how much you want to spend?
I was wondering what you always send out as gifts..
For a move, how about a decorative indoor plant?
There are many firms who rent potted plants for their offices, but most still seem very happy to receive something like that as a gift.
Especially if they have many conference and meeting rooms, they are perfect as decorations.
They also last for a long time.
We can also add a plaque with our company name with the gift which will show their visiting clients our relationship.
I see.
We usually choose pachira, yucca and ficus benjamina...
Our budget is usually somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 yen.
I'm not familiar with those plants but are they like the ones in our entrance lobby?
Yes, something pretty ordinary.
You can choose which kind and let's spend 15,000 yen.
Let's also choose a big planter for it.
OK, I will do that.
What name should I ask to put on the plaque?
Please put the president's name.
Got it, I will make arrangements immediately.
My name is Koizumi, pleased to meet you, I am starting today.
I am Muto, in charge of new recruits, pleased to meet you as well.
Koizumi san, please wear this hat before entering the kitchen.
Please make sure that no hair is showing.
Is it OK to put hair clips in?
As long as it's inside the hat.
Next please properly wash your hands with soap for 3 minutes before disinfecting with alcohol.
You take such care of hygiene!
We basically need perfect hygiene to avoid food poisoning.
Let start packing rice for the bento boxes.
Will you scoop 200 grams of rice, weigh it on this scale, and put it into the container?
It's hard to be exactly 200 grams.
As long as it's within 215 grams, don't worry about the difference.
But make sure it is not less.
Otherwise, some customers weigh the amount of rice and complain that there isn't enough.
I understand and will be careful.
After the rice, put this heated the boil-in-the-bag ingredient onto the rice.
What dish are we making?
A Chinese donburi which is one of the most popular product at our supermarket.
Here it is, is this good?
The topping is all in the middle, make sure it's spread evenly over the rice.
Please place the pickles on the right side and then put a lid on it.
Is this done?
No, we still need to put the product sticker on.
Is it this "Chinese bento box 500 yen" sticker?
No, this is a "Chinese bowl" not a "Chinese bento box".
People have been applying the stickers inconsistently recently so please make sure that you're matching the stickers and food correctly.
I will be careful, is there a particular position for the stickers?
Yes, always make sure the sticker is visible the right hand side.
So as this is done, we bring it out to the counter.
Any place in particular?
Please place it with the rest of the Chinese food in the corner with the chili shrimps and fried rice.
Anywhere in that section should be fine.
We just made this one so should it go to the back of the shelf?
Normally, most supermarkets apply a first in first out system.
We differentiate ourselves from other supermarkets by providing freshly made ones.
Please place the newly made items in front of the older ones.
I understand, I went and placed it with the rest of them.
OK then, please make 10 more of the same "Chinese donburi".
Alright.
How are you Tanaka-san.
How are you Funakoshi-san.
By the way, I'd like to advance the publishing deadline for the spring catalog to the 14th.
Do you think you can finish up the page in regards to the furniture products by then?
I don't think that will be a problem.
Most of the design is already done.
But the price of the product isn't decided yet.
Oh, Okada-san.
Did you get the final version of the product price list from the marketing department?
No, not yet.
The submission deadline was yesterday, right?
Yet we haven't heard anything yet.
Hmm, I will contact someone from the marketing department.
Then Tanaka-san will be able to finish the catalog, right?
Yes, that would be great.
Yeah, the catalog is our top priority.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll leave that to you.
Yeah, I'll contact you later.
Thank you for calling, my name is Shibuya from Trust Company M, Transfer Agent Department.
Thank you as always, I am Takada from Company I.
Mr. Takada, thank you as always.
Sorry, is Nose-san at his seat?
You would like to speak to Nose-san, please hold wait a moment.
Thank you for holding, this is Nose.
Oh, Nose-san, this is Takada.
Sorry about yesterday, I couldn't pick up the phone as I was out.
No, it's okay.
Thank you for sending the documents I asked for.
It was helpful.
Was that good enough?
It was enough to get a general understanding.
But I'm not that confident when it comes to actually proceeding with discussions with the management team.
The content is pretty tricky to discuss over the phone so would it be possible to meet in person?
That's fine.
Apologies for the sudden request but could you give me some of your time sometimes this week?
I can visit your office if it's tomorrow afternoon, does that work with you?
Okay, how about 1 o'clock in the afternoon at our office.
Okay.
I will also bring some materials that I can't really send by email.
That will be helpful, I will also review what I want to discuss about by the time we meet.
Okay, I will wait for you tomorrow.
Okay, alright then, bye now.
Thank you for calling company I, this is Noda speaking.
Good morning, this is Imai from sales department, is Mr. Akawa available right now?
Good morning, hold on one second please.
Hello, this is Akawa.
Good morning, this is Imai.
Good morning, what's going on?
I am so sorry to tell you this, I came down with a fever last night and it hasn't broken yet.
I have a terrible headache too, and I am wondering if I can take today off.
Are you alright?
You know it's the flu season, do you think you came down with it?
My son was sick with the flu a few days ago, it is possible.
I am about to go to the clinic.
If you have the flu, I need you to get completely better before coming back to work.
According to our company policy, you can come back 5 days after the onset of the sickness and you have been fever free for 2 days.
I understand.
Can you call me back about the diagnosis later?
I sure will, and I apologize for the inconvenience my absence may cause.
Don't you worry about that, take care.
By the way do you have any urgent appointments?
I have one, an appointment with Mr. Yamada from company A.
I was supposed to go visit him.
Can it be rescheduled or do we need to send a someone else there?
It is not that urgent, just a meeting to gather and exchange information, so it can be rescheduled.
Ok, I will let them know about your situation.
I appreciate you doing that for me.
Don't worry, just get better.
Thank you so much, and please call me if something changes.
I got it, take care.
Ok, talk to you later.
Tomoi-san, sorry for bothering you but do you have a moment?
Oh, Noda-san, what's wrong?
I got a call from the preschool that my son goes to on my cell phone just now.
It seems my son suddenly got a fever and they are asking me to pick him up right away.
I'd like to call it a day and leave now for today but is that okay?
Of course, hurry up and go pick him up.
Thank you very much and sorry for the inconvenience.
I'd like to check the schedule for today and tomorrow before you leave.
Do you need to handover any tasks in particular?
If your son got a fever today, it might be hard for you to come to work tomorrow, right?
Thank you for your consideration.
I just have admin work to do at the office today so I don't have anything that has to be done right away.
The person in charge at Securities Company M plans on coming to our office tomorrow in regards to work related to stock ownership plan.
If that appointment isn't in a rush, why don't you reschedule the meeting?
I will contact them to change the date.
Then can I just ask you to do that?
Of course.
Is everything else okay?
Nothing in particular I think.
Okay, take care.
Thank you very much, I'll be leaving now.
I'd like to now begin the second meeting.
Thank you.
Did everyone think about an exporting plan?
I did think about it but it was pretty hard as it was my first time.
Okay, can we start with you, Komiya-kun?
Yes, okay.
I still think the first trial export should target Japanese people living in Singapore and export the products we sell in Japan today would be good.
I see.
By targeting Japanese people, we can simply export the existing products that we have.
If we narrow down our sales point to places where Japanese people tend to gather in the local area, we should be able to reduce our expenses too.
I agree with Komiya-san's idea.
Can you tell us about your idea too, Murata-san?
I think we should first target Japanese people living locally as well.
It's a small country so I think if we can get supermarkets where Japanese people go often to cooperate with us and sell through there will be the most realistic.
Sato-san, I have a question.
What is it, Kobayashi-kun.
This team is still formed with volunteers and is not an official team but do we have a budget?
I think it will depend on the direction we take from now and have the president and the general affairs department decide.
If that is the case, will it be possible for us to go to Singapore and do field research as well as distributing samples?
I'd like to learn about what kind of things are sold locally for future reference, and listen to the actual comments of locals by distributing samples directly to non-Japanese people.
That's a good idea, I'm in favor of that.
I'm in favor of that too.
I see, I think that's a good idea as well.
Okay, let's use this plan as a base and form a plan that can convince the president and the general affairs department.
Yasuda-san, sorry I am a little late.
Here are all the documents for the travel expenses.
Thank you, it didn't take you long at all.
I am so sorry, I seem to have lost the receipt for the shinkansen ticket to the airport, is there anything I can do?
Shinkansen fare isn't cheap.
In case of a lost receipt, this different form needs to be filled out.
I need to write down the reason for the lost item, right?
Yes, you just need to be honest and write you lost it.
I gotcha.
Then I am going to go fill out this form now.
Wait a second.
Let me check to see everything else is filled out correctly.
Please do that for me.
What rate did you use for the local hotel fee?
I used the rate I saw on the Internet today and calculated it.
Sorry, can you calculate it using the M bank's rate on the day you got your receipt?
Yes sir.
Everything looks great other than that, so please fix those two things.
Ishii-san, do you have a moment?
What is it?
I got a call just a while ago from the nursery.
My child vomited out the school lunch and has a fever of 39 degrees.
Oh my, 39 degrees!
Is it alright if I leave work early?
I apologize for asking for such a favor at a busy time.
I would like to pick my child up as soon as possible.
You must be worried.
You can go pick up your child.
What about your work, though?
I've asked Yoshida-san to take care of inputting the vouchers.
What about the quotation form we asked you to send company A this morning?
I already sent the e-mail.
I've also finished filling out the daily report.
Alright then.
Perhaps you'll have to take a break from work if your child has the flu.
I might have to if that's the case.
But I haven't heard any outbreak of the flu at the nursery, so I think it might be fine.
If ever my child does have the flu, then I'll have to take the day off tomorrow.
My husband has the day off the day after tomorrow on Friday, so I'll make sure to show up to work by then.
I still have to finish the outputs for the invoices.
I see.
It would be a big help then if you could show up on Friday.
I'll go pick my child up then and proceed to the pediatrician.
I'll make sure to give a call whether I can come to work or not tomorrow once we have finished with the check-up.
Alright then.
I hope your child gets better after a night's rest.
I hope so too.
I'll be on my way then.
Alright.
I wish the best for your child.
Thank you.
Hey, do you have time?
What's up?
I've got something on my mind.
Such as?
I noticed that Mr. Ueda gives me so many receipts recently.
He says they are for the company meetings.
Has he been so busy these days?
I didn't think he was so busy as far as I know.
He gives me a restaurant receipt every weekend regularly, saying it's for a company meeting.
It was a French restaurant in a three-star-hotel last weekend.
Wow, that's luxury.
Also, he gave me a receipt of a nightclub in Roppongi.
Gosh!
It's been a month, so I've started to feel suspicious.
What do you think?
It sounds a bit dodgy from your story.
Yeah.
What shall I do?
Let me see …
Who is Mr. Ueda's client?
Trading company U.
Eh, I've heard we had closed the deal with company U two weeks ago.
Is that so?
I'll find a paper to confirm.
Why don't you take the paper and talk to Mr. Ueda to check the details?
Well, I'm not sure if I can do it.
He is bit a domineering to us as he is a branch manager's favourite.
True.
I've been offended by him many times.
Oh, how about speaking to Ms. Yamamoto for help?
Ah, good idea!
She's been working here longer than Mr. Ueda.
He might be listening to her obediently.
Yes, it'll be so wrong if the receipts were for private use.
I'll have a word with Ms.Yamamoto now.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Today we'd like to discuss our charity activities.
As you know, we go to a developing country every year for charity work.
In addition to that, what else can we do?
Is that limited to overseas activities?
Or can we do something here?
Either will do.
Any ideas?
I have something for domestic activities.
How about making a food donation as a company.
As we are all busy working, it's not easy to be away.
So we could put a large box and ask the employees to bring in some unwanted tinned or preserved food.
I don't think it would cause much trouble.
That's a good idea.
My kid's school had a food donation week before.
I heard they collected loads of donation.
Where do we donate the collected food?
We could bring them in to a local church.
Or, we could send them to a volunteer group offering a food bank.
Sounds good.
Actually, we can see lots of homeless or people on benefits in our area.
It's very important to help our neighbours, isn't it?
I have many unopened tinned food at home.
So do I.
I stocked up some for the emergency, but forgot to use them up.
Maybe more people in our office are similar.
Oh!
How about asking everybody to bring along the old clothes as well?
Particularly, children's clothing is in demand.
Agree!
Kids quickly grow out of the clothes.
So, I'm sure kids' clothes will be well accepted.
Okay, then we'll do.
So, we've agreed to ask donation of food and clothing internally.
I'll work on an e-mail message and send it out to the employees.
Is it okay if we start on Monday the week after.
Yes.
I'll find a box for the donation.
Thanks.
I hope we will have a lot of donation.
Indeed.
Hi this is Tamamoto from Company N.
Hi Tamamoto-san, this is Shibuya.
Hope you are well Shibuya-san.
Is it okay if I ask for a small favor?
Yes, what is it?
Can I ask you to change my flight for my business trip to Tokyo tomorrow?
I suddenly have to go for a business meeting in the morning.
Okay, you're currently taking the one departing Nagoya at eight thirty via Airline B?
No, it's the one leaving around 8 o'clock via Airline A.
Okay, will any flight departing in the afternoon work?
Yeah, the business meeting is from 9 o'clock and should take 2 hours so any flight after twelve thirty will be good.
But it would be better if I have more time for the business trip to Tokyo so maybe an earlier flight in the afternoon would be good.
Hmm, I just checked the flight for Airline A and the earliest available flight is from 5 o'clock.
Is it that full?
Unfortunately yes.
Should I take a look at Airline B?
Yes, please, 5 o'clock is a bit too late.
Thank you for waiting, it seems Airline B is fully booked until the evening.
I wonder if there is some event or something.
That's no good, is there any with the LCC?
LCC flights, let me check.
No there aren't any, how about the bullet train?
The bullet train isn't convenient so I'm actually not fond of it.
Yeah, but what else can we do?
Hmm, I'll call the person I'm meeting and will ask to shift the business meeting to a later date.
So you can leave the reservation as is.
Understood.
And can I ask you to do one more thing?
Yes, what is it?
It's in regards to the hotel in Tokyo tomorrow, I was looking at the confirmation email and noticed that it was a smoking room.
I must have made a mistake when I booked it.
Can you call the hotel and ask if there are non-smoking rooms available, and if so can you change the room?
Okay, which hotel is it?
It's Hotel N in Ginza.
Okay.
My battery on my phone is running low so can you send me an email on what you find out?
Okay, I'll get back to you on this.
Midorikawa-san, how are you!
So tomorrow is the sales department's new employee welcoming party, go have lots of fun.
I look forward to it but I'm also a bit depressed.
What's wrong, are you worried about something?
It will be different from a drinking party from a club in my university days so I'm worried I will get out of line.
You were worried about something like that?
I think you can just express your gratitude to the party and just enjoy it normally as usual.
Normally as usual, that's all?
You're supposed to have fun with everyone at welcoming parties, it's also to learn more about each other.
They will have a weird impression of you if you are too uptight and awkward about it.
So just like that, being normal is the best, right?
Is there anything that a new employee must do at drinking parties?
Well, it would be good if you are attentive.
Like making sure everyone has an extra plate or making sure everyone has got their alcohol.
Pouring some alcohol in their glass if it's getting less.
When should I be pouring it?
Like one third?
Or when the glass is completely empty?
People preferences varies but I'm the type that does it when it is empty.
There isn't really a set amount.
You will probably know if you try pouring it once when it is around one third.
People who dislike it will say no and those who are fine will just hand you their glass.
But I don't think you have to be that detailed and attentive, just pour it when you notice it.
I see, got it.
Should I be pouring alcohol to managers or the section chief?
I think it would be good to go at least once.
So I should go around in order in terms of rank?
Yeah, by rank in general.
Where is the venue tomorrow?
I heard it is at the banquet hall of Hotel H beside Station S.
Then I think there will be around 6 people sitting around a round table.
If the section chief is sitting with you then you can ignore the rank and just pour it for the section chief first.
Also, they serve a French course menu so make sure to eat at a pace that others are eating at.
If you are oddly slow or fast, they may think you are the type that does things at your own pace.
Okay, I grew up with older and younger brothers so I eat fast but I will be careful.
Finally, be sure to remember this by all means.
Be sure to not get too drunk not just for new employee welcome party but for future company drinking parties.
There are people who completely change without realizing when they get too drunk.
Okay, thank you for your advice.
But their lobster cream sauce is awesome, have fun!
Hello Yanaka san, it's a pleasure, as always.
Hello Miyajima san, the pleasure is all mine.
Today, I wanted to discuss the health examination situation with you.
Oh yes, we need to provide medical examinations for our employees.
That's right, it is mandated by the Labor Safety and Health Act.
It's very strict now that there's been an increase in health disorders due to long working hours.
Alright, then we must get this in order.
Do we send them to one of the company approved hospitals?
That is one option.
Or the company can organize a group health examination, or allow each employee to take an exam and submit results.
I see, there are many options, which would you recommend?
I recommend using one of the G prefectural health insurance association approved medical institutions for your company.
That would be the easiest option.
Would it have to be a medical institution approved by the health insurance association?
As a general rule, yes.
We have an L hospital as our client.
I was hoping we can use the hospital, if possible.
Let's see, I will check the list right now.
Well, L hospital is...
Unfortunately is not on the list.
Hum, how can we use this hospital?
The company would have to cover the costs for the health examinations.
I can contact L hospital and tell them not to charge the fees from the employees ahead of time.
There might be incidences where they might request something other than what's required when the exams are done individually.
Can you give me an example?
For example, in a case when an employee chooses a gastroscopy procedure, rather than taking barium.
The cost difference will be an additional 20,000 yen.
I see.
We would need to inform the employees in advance that there are different options.
I will draw up a memo for the health exam.
That would be great, thank you.
Would we need to get all of them to take the exam around the same time?
I think it will be difficult for all of them to go around the same time due to site constraints.
I  agree and  they won't need to do it at the same time.
Also, it is not required by law to pay employees during the examination.
But it is recommended that the company treat that time as work, and provide pay.
Most employees consider it as a company requirement that they do the exam.
I understand, we will treat it as working hours.
OK, I will let you know when I prepare the memo for the health exam.
That would be great, thank you.
Just because we're new, why do we have to take the initiative in picking up calls?
Why can't whoever is available pick it up?
That's true.
But if you take the initiative and pick up, it will be a chance for the other party to know that a new person joined and to remember your name.
And if the way you handled the call was good, your reputation will get better from outside and inside the company.
Oh, that'd be nice.
So, please do pick up the calls.
Then why is it that we have to gather reference materials and pick out information?
Isn't this something that the author should do?
Well, there are amateur authors and of course professional authors who do it themselves.
But I want the author to focus on the story in front of them now.
Gathering reference materials does take some time to do.
So, I'd rather have the author spend that time writing.
Also, gathering materials and picking out the information from a different perspective can bring about a new idea for the author too.
So it's not just simply gathering materials.
I believe that things like that are part of an editor's job.
I see, there is such a meaning behind that too.
Thank you very much Sasaki-san.
Good morning, Satoru!
Hi, Ron, you're pretty hyper today.
What's up?
Have you heard that our biometric sensor will be on TV soon?
Ah, I've heard someone was saying something about that, I guess.
We'll be on the news show for T Station every Thursday night.
You know "State of the Art Technology of the Week" section in that show, don't you?
Oh, I watch that quite often, too!
Oh, yeah, F Corporation was on that show the other day, showing their cyber security system that uses AI or something.
That's right, that person from F was pretty good at talking.
I've heard that section is actually shot in one go.
Wow, but they often ask some sharp questions, don't they?
This laboratory has quite a few of projects with non-disclosure agreement, so we have to be careful what we say, huh?
Who's going to be on the show from our lab?
I guess Kaname would be the one.
He's our Chief of the Development, too.
And he knows everything about our sensor.
Then I can relax in front of the TV if he'll be on air.
Oh, speaking of the devil...
Good morning, Kaname!
Good morning.
What are you all chatting about gathering together?
Am I missing on something here guys?
Well, we were just talking about our sensor being introduced on TV, Kaname.
Oh, that, you guys have sharp ears, huh?
When is it going to be on air, Kaname?
I think it'll be on about three weeks from now.
Have they shot already?
Not yet, it's supposed to be next Tuesday afternoon.
A camera crew is coming here from the TV station.
Wow, where are they shooting?
I believe they'll shoot it in Meeting Room 1.
They said they'd prefer a spacious room with lots of light.
Well then, should we put away some of the stuff like the whiteboard in the room?
It's okay, they want to shoot in our usual setting.
I'm relieved that they won't go into the messy lab.
Argh, why does it have to be on that day, I'll be gone on a business trip!
You have nothing to do with shooting, though.
Well, I'm a fan of that reporter girl!
I know you want to chat a bit more, but we have a morning meeting in 10 minutes, all right?
Well, so that's about it for the morning meeting today?
Oh, I'd like to confirm one more thing.
About the TV coverage next week, which sensor are we showing them?
Well, Kentaro wanted to put out the latest ones, but....
We haven't completed testing for the one with vein authentication yet, you know?
We're still developing 3D sensors for face recognition, too.
So, we've decided to show our iris authentication sensor currently mounted on F Corporation's S phone.
As for our latest sensors, it's probably safer to mention a little at the end of the coverage.
Phew, I was worried if something went wrong like that time with that fingerprint sensor.
I still carry that trauma, you know?
Oh, that was chilling, and it was a live show, too!
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
About fingerprint authentication?
Oh, yeah, it was quite a while ago so maybe you weren't around then, Anna.
About 10 years ago, I believe?
Yes, like this time, a TV show covered our fingerprint recognition sensor which we had just developed at the time.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out properly during the live report, and we couldn't cover for the trouble on the fly either.
Yeah, this lab's reputation took a nosedive then, and we had to spend few years to recover!
Kentaro insisted that he'd show the latest product at the time as well.
Unlike this time, I couldn't convince him not to.
But I think the big part of it was that Toru fiddled around with the sensor, even though he didn't know much about how to use it.
He's the director of this laboratory, but just a figurehead, a retired official, isn't he?
Whoa, you should watch your mouth, Ron.
Well, seriously, he always intervenes in projects he doesn't really understands, and gets us into troubles.
Last week too, Toru followed me to see my presentation at F Corporation, though.
He just kept telling them unnecessary things, so I had to spend so much extra time to follow up with explanations for each and every aspect.
Oh, he did that to me, too, at an exhibition last month!
He spoke to participants as if he knew everything, you know?
I had to be on the watch and cover for him throughout the event, made me super exhausted!
He should learn more about our products if he wants to go speak in public.
Well, everybody, calm down a bit, don't be so hard on him.
Toru is thinking of how he'd do better this time, so he should be okay.
Wait, wait a sec, what do you mean he'd be okay?
Well, you were all talking about it, weren't you?
About Toru's appearance, on TV.
You're not saying that Toru will be on the show this time with our iris recognition sensor, are you?
Yes, you didn't know?
No, no, no, that's definitely impossible!
No, way, no more of that nightmare!
Is he trying to traumatize the whole Lab now?
Hello everyone, let's get started with today's meeting.
My name is Okada.
Nice to meet you all.
Since this is our first meeting, let's begin with a quick introduction around the table.
Then, I am going to give you a brief introduction of our new project.
I am going to be leading this team for the duration of this project.
I normally work at unit one in the Sales Department.
Please come and talk to me at my desk in unit one, if you have any questions or suggestions.
It's nice meeting you all today.
Would you like to introduce yourself next, Ms. Kishida?
Sure.
Nice to meet you all, I'm Kishida.
I am at unit two in the Sales Department.
I look forward to working with you all.
Nice meeting you too, Ms. Kishida.
My name is Miyamoto.
I work in the Sales Promotion Department.
I look forward to collaborating with you both.
We are now going to talk about the outline of this project.
The new project aims to identify new users for our payment settlement system.
Furthermore, we are also looking at extending our services to new types of users from our list of sales leads.
What exactly do you mean by new type of users?
Good question, it means we are aiming to attract not only retail shops or restaurants but also any other potential opportunities.
I see.
Ok.
We want to get various type of users.
That's right.
That's why our team comprises different sales departments and divisions.
Exactly.
Each department or unit has a different marketing strategy, and that would be our strength.
Yes.
Let's make this project a success.
Yes, let's try our best!
Of course we will have a revenue target, but we will go into that more in our next meeting.
Anyway, we should close the meeting here as we are running out of time.
I'll email you the schedule for the next meeting and the supplemental documents later.
Yes, noted.
Yes, please.
Hi Kana, can I ask you something?
Sure.
There is a student who wants to send his personal belongings to Japan by sea.
He's leaving the country next month, and he came to the office yesterday asking for advice.
I understand that we usually use Company Y for the shipment, but when I called them this morning to get a quote, they basically told me it would cost more than 1000 pounds.
Since that is way out of his budget, I am trying to find other ways of doing it.
Right.
Company Y offers the service as one whole package, and while it is very convenient, it tends to be a bit overpriced.
If we can find a shipping company here, and a custom broker and a delivery company in Japan separately by ourselves the total fee should be cheaper.
I see.
We had a similar case a few years ago.
I think I can find the record here, give me a sec.
Thanks.
Here it is.
We asked Company W to collect the cargo and ship to the Japanese Port in Tokyo, then for the custom paperwork we asked Company E and they arranged the delivery for us as well.
The total fee was 500 pounds.
Obviously, the fee will change depending on the size and the weight of the cargo as well as the value of the contents.
We could avoid getting any custom charge for this case, so that was good.
How much stuff is he going to send?
It should be about the same as hers.
Ok, well obviously we shouldn't expect it to be exactly the same, but I'd say we can do it in the same way this time.
Yeah, I will call Company W.
They would need a rough amount of the package and a value of the contents so maybe check with the student first.
Ah, yes.
I will email him.
Oh, also Company W may have introduced CMS so check that with them too.
What is CMS?
It's "container management surcharge".
It is a little unclear if that is really a thing, but some shipping companies charge the broker when they unload the cargos at the port.
It's like a handling fee.
I see.
Company W did not charge us the last time so hopefully it still is the case.
Yeah.
Can I ask you to send me the file of the previous case?
I want to go through it.
Of course.
Actually, I am going to make it anonymous and upload it on our shared database.
We may have similar cases in the future.
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Thanks for offering to help me with my presentation.
I've never given a presentation in front of such big audience before.
I'm glad I could help!
What are you planning?
I'm thinking about using a slide show.
I'll probably include a pie chart showing our demographic.
Then I'll use a bar graph to show our numbers for each region.
I would suggest explaining the graph rather than just showing.
Be sure to point out what each axis means.
That way, you can make sure everyone understands what you're trying to show.
Also, make sure the colors between the sections of the graph stand out easily.
Don't make it too fancy, though.
It's better to keep it pretty simple.
Okay!
That makes sense.
How does this theme look?
That one is a bit too complicated.
It's hard to read what the labels say.
I think you should try this one instead.
Thanks.
Do you have any tips for the actual presentation?
I would say practice a few times before.
Space out your practice between a few days, so you won't be too stressed by practicing on the last day.
Just don't be too nervous, and make sure to look around the room rather than at the white board.
The more you have your presentation memorized, the easier it will be to make eye contact with people.
I'll be sure to practice.
That's the part I'm most worried about.
Thank you for your help!
No problem.
Good luck!
